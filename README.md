# TemperatureMonitorApp

This app allows users to view the temperature and humidity in a room. It fetches data from the backend system available at [TemperatureMonitorSystem](https://github.com/LuWroblewski/TemperatureMonitorSystem).

The temperature and humidity data is obtained from the [TemperatureMonitorESP32](https://github.com/LuWroblewski/TemperatureMonitorESP32) repository.
